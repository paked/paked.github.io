Welcome to my website.

This is a list of stuff I currently do:

- procrastinate uni
- [think about how we can teach people to code better](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
- tutor [COMP1720 (Art & Interaction in New Media)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720) (semester 2, 2019 and 2020), and [COMP2300 (Computer Organisation & Program Execution)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300) (semester 1, 2020 and 2021)
- hack on [CECS's](https://cecs.anu.edu.au) teaching infrastructure with [Ben](https://benswift.me)
- run around in the dark with a map and compass (when i'm not injured)
- ride a bike with only one gear

If you're looking for my past coding related endeavours, a decent selection of them are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/paked).
