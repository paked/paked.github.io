Welcome to my website.

When I'm not being a software engineer I:

- run around in the dark with a map and compass
- cook tasty food
- ride a bike with only one gear

Things I've done in the past:

- tutor [COMP1720 (Art & Interaction in New Media)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720) (semester 2, 2019 and 2020), and [COMP2300 (Computer Organisation & Program Execution)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300) (semester 1, 2020 and 2021)

If you're looking for my past coding related endeavours, a decent selection of them are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/paked).
