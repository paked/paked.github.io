title: "Bare metal hacking on the Raspberry Pi 3 for fun and (little) profit"

There's a lot of info out there about bare metal hacking with the Raspberry Pi,
but it's not particularly well organised---and for various reasons, quite
inconsistent. So here's my take on it.

I wanted to get into bare metal RPI hacking to learn a bit more about operating
system development, . I've designed this setup with a couple of things in mind:

1. it should be modern
2. it should be cheap.

So, all the information in this post relates to the bare metal hacking of a
Raspberry Pi 3 (specifically the 3 A+), in 64bit aarch64 mode.

## Stuff to buy

- A USB to TTY adapter (and female-female du pont jumpers)
- a Raspberry Pi 3
- a microSD card and reader

## Setting up an SD Card

## Project set up

## Hello World (and what the heck is a UART)

## Exception Levels

## Exceptions

## Context switching
