- in February 2020, a week before class started the Australian government banned all international travel originating in China.
- we got word 40% of our students would not be able to get to class in person.
- most courses, it seemed, would start to figure this stuff out in week 1
- but we had a problem
- our course relies on a physical board we hand out in the first lab of the course; a "discoboard"
- we were faced with a problem: we had 400 discoboards sitting in an office (funnily, weeks earlier there had been discussion as to what we would do if they didn't arrive in time for class)
- ultimately, due to the genius of one of our tutors who made an emulator for our particular board suited for our particular purposes, we were saved --- and didn't have to do any magic stuff
i'm (perhaps not so, really) unique in the fact that i'm a tutor, and a student at the university.
- i see how the sausage is made, and then go on to eat it for lunch
- over the past few months there's been a lot of discussion in our community about how to teach students online --- and some, i'm concerned, has missed the point.
- i'm sure a lot of what i'm about to right may be self evident

There's one piece of, well, over arching advice that you need to understand in order to start this entire discussion: **You can't treat online classes the same as in person classes**.

## Learnings

### Students are social creatures

### You can't drift downstream on a road

### Video chats are a performance

### You've gotta be creative

### You've gotta send the right messages

## Going forward

- Here at the ANU we're in the middle of our semester break.
- It's been a tough semester
- I was a tutor (or teaching assistant, as they're called in the US) at one of the larger courses in my faculty
- I was on the front lines of the universities shift into an online teaching environment
- The course I was in tried very hard to adapt to the changing circumstances
- Before week 1 the Australian government blocked all travel from China, so a decent portion of our course was already going to have to run online.
- We were lucky in that our course was already very online friendly.
- I feel like I learnt a lot this semester, and I think it'd be a shame to not pass it on.
- By week 4 we shifted entirely online

### Key lessons:

- Online is not the same as in-person
- Being on video for long periods of time is draining (and no one likes doing it)
- If you don't want your labs to turn into lectures, you can't run them as a lecture
- Students already don't like asking for help, make it easy for them to receive it

### How we applied these lessons

In labs:

- We used teams
- Have an all-hands-on-deck video call at the start of each lab -- make announcements about the course, field any questions, etc.
  - record this, in teams it's easily searchable for students who arrive late
- After this video call (usually about 5 mins), the tutors returned to a private call for coordination
- We instructed students to ask their questions in the text chat
- If a student had a question which might be applicable to other people, a public call was made
  - But if it was to do with an assignment or some other nitty gritty debugging we would do it privately
- Send messages halfway through the lab to see how people were going

Things we experimented with:

- Having the "tutor coordination call" public
- Running a kahoot at the start of the lab

### Things we want to improve

While I feel like we've made a bit of progress this semester with the design of
our online labs for teaching, I feel like labs are still missing that special
something that comes from having a bunch of people in the same place together:
they're missing that element of "fun".
