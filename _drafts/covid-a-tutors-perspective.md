title: "COVID: a tutors perspective"
---

- Here at the ANU we're in the middle of our semester break.
- It's been a tough semester
- I was a tutor (or teaching assistant, as they're called in the US) at one of the larger courses in my faculty
- I was on the front lines of the universities shift into an online teaching environment
- The course I was in tried very hard to adapt to the changing circumstances
- Before week 1 the Australian government blocked all travel from China, so a decent portion of our course was already going to have to run online.
- We were lucky in that our course was already very online friendly.
- I feel like I learnt a lot this semester, and I think it'd be a shame to not pass it on.
- By week 4 we shifted entirely online

### Key lessons:

- Online is not the same as in-person
- Being on video for long periods of time is draining (and no one likes doing it)
- If you don't want your labs to turn into lectures, you can't run them as a lecture
- Students already don't like asking for help, make it easy for them to receive it

### How we applied these lessons

In labs:

- We used teams
- Have an all-hands-on-deck video call at the start of each lab -- make announcements about the course, field any questions, etc.
  - record this, in teams it's easily searchable for students who arrive late
- After this video call (usually about 5 mins), the tutors returned to a private call for coordination
- We instructed students to ask their questions in the text chat
- If a student had a question which might be applicable to other people, a public call was made
  - But if it was to do with an assignment or some other nitty gritty debugging we would do it privately
- Send messages halfway through the lab to see how people were going

Things we experimented with:

- Having the "tutor coordination call" public
- Running a kahoot at the start of the lab

### Things we want to improve

While I feel like we've made a bit of progress this semester with the design of
our online labs for teaching, I feel like labs are still missing that special
something that comes from having a bunch of people in the same place together:
they're missing that element of "fun".
