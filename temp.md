# Hi, I'm Harrison.

I got halfway through a re-design of my site over the 2019 mid-semester break, and true to form didn't finish it off by the time uni restarted. So this is what we're going with in the meantime.

Quickly, I: study at ANU, make stuff, teach stuff, and mess around in the outdoors.

In more detail, I:

- think about how we can teach people to code better
- tutor COMP1720 (semester 2, 2019 and 2020) and COMP2300 (semester 1 2020)
- hack on CECS's teaching infrastructure with ben
- run around in the dark with a map and compass
- ride a bike with only one gear

In the past I wrote a bunch of open source stuff:

- EngoEngine
- Messenger
- Configure

...but I'm not doing so much of that any more.

If you want to get in contact with me: email me at `firstname@theshoebridges.com`.
